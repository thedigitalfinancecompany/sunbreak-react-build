```

Or, if using Yarn or pnpm:

```bash
yarn add https://github.com/thedigitalfinancecompany/sunbreak-react-dist/releases/download/v0.0.1/sunbreak-react-0.0.1.tgz
# or
pnpm add https://github.com/thedigitalfinancecompany/sunbreak-react-dist/releases/download/v0.0.1/sunbreak-react-0.0.1.tgz
```

You can specify any available release version (e.g., `v0.0.2`, `v0.0.3`) to install a particular build.

Once installed, import and use it in your React application.
